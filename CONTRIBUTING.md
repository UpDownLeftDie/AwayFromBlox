## Getting started

This project uses version 2 of AutoHotkey. You can download it here [AutoHotkey Download Page](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/)  
When looking through the AHK docs **its important to make sure you're looking at the v2 docs: [https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/AutoHotkey.htm](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/AutoHotkey.htm)**

You should also be using some kind of formatter, like [AutoHotkey Plus Plus](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus)  
Note: at the time of writing this doesn't support AHK v2 so some of the code complete suggestions are **incorrect** (see: [#146](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus/issues/146))
