## Getting started

This project uses version 2 of AutoHotkey. You can download it here [AutoHotkey Download Page](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/)\
When looking through the AHK docs **its important to make sure you're looking at the v2 docs: [https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/AutoHotkey.htm](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/AutoHotkey.htm)**\
\
You should also be using some kind of formatter, like [AutoHotkey v2 Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp)
